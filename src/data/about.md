# Intro

I am a recent graduate of The City College of New York. Prior to that I spent seven years working as a Boeing 777 mechanic in Everett, WA. In 2015, my partner and I moved to New York to pursue our passions. With a degree in hand I'm ready to enter the world of software engineering. I'm particularly interested in aerospace, security, and environmental ventures. 

# Currently

Developing a touch-screen raspberry pi based inventory system. A problem that research labs have is losing track of virus samples in their freezer. This system, in association with a web app, will help track information relating to the samples as well as quantity. The largest hurdle is the search feature.

# Interesting

- As a child, my parents weren't very computer literate. I was forced to learn on my own. The first family computer was purchased when I was about 6 years old.

- The first PC game that I played was [X-Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_X-Wing). It was on a floppy disk and ran completely from the DOS command line. I think I ended up spending more time messing with the CLI than playing the actual game. Side note, the game was awesome.

- At 9, I played Microsoft Pinball obsessively. I'm confident that I still own the high score on thatcomputer. Also, I became an expert at Minesweeper.

- At 13, I became obsessed with counter-strike. I created a website for my clan and began my journey to become the best CS player in the nation, which would never happen.

- When I was 16 years old I won 4,000 dollars in an online poker tournament taking 7th out of 1400. I used this money to build my first gaming computer.
